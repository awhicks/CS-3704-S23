## Step 1: Complete H07

The homework assignment H07 includes working through some basic JavaScript tutorials, and answering some questions about
JavaScript.

The tutorial was designed to prepare you for precisely the JavaScript concepts and skills you need to do the next step 
of this assignment, so I encourage you to do it first, before proceeding to the next step.
     
## Step 2: A JavaScript Callbacks tutorial

Two important JavaScript concepts are *callbacks* and *promises*.  Promises are easier to understand if you first work with callbacks.

This online textbook chapter presents an example of callbacks in the context of using JavaScript code to examine the file system.

Please read through the chapter,  try the code examples.

Then look through the exercises; they will then be divided between programming exercises and homework exercises.
