This lab is a team-based lab; it is essentially the same lab as jpa03, but done at
the team level.


Detailed instructions are located in the lecture notes for 1/20/2021:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/lectures/lect07/>


Check to make sure that:
* Your app is deployed on Heroku
* You can login and logout of the running app on Heroku successfully with your UCSB Google Account (i.e. your userid@ucsb.edu email address)
* You have a "green check" on GitHub for your repo, indicating that the tests are passing
* Codecov is configured correctly
* The README.md is modified correctly

At that point, one person from your team can submit on Gauchospace (on behalf of the entire team) using this link:
