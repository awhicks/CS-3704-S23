In these two repos, you will find these directories:

* w22-5pm-1, w22-6pm-1 and w22-7pm-1 does issues from `issues/epic01` under courses
* w22-5pm-2, w22-6pm-2 and w22-7pm-2 does issues from `issues/epic02` under courses
* w22-5pm-3 w22-6pm-3 and w22-7pm-3 does issues from `issues/epic03` under cows
* w22-5pm-4 w22-6pm-4 and w22-7pm-4 does issues from `issues/epic04` under cows

We have set up repos for each of the teams.  Note that teams work in pairs in the same repo:

| Team | Team | Repo |

You will NOT be able to merge your own pull requests on this project. Instead:
* You need to get the PR to be fully green on CI/CD (i.e. all GitHub actions scripts passing)
* You need to get at least one approved code review from a fellow team member that did not work on the story
* You need to a get a *code review from a staff member*
* The staff member will then merge the PR, *and award points to your team*.

Your team should try  to accumulate 100 points to get full credit (you may go up to 110 for extra credit.)

If you only accumulate 90, that's an A-, 83 is a B, etc.
