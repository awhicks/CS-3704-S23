These are the instructions for the legacy code project phase of the course.

Everything up until now has been a kind of "warm up" for this.  This is when you work on a project that:
* has "real users" 
* has a code base that was worked on by students before this quarter (specifically during W22)
* has a code based that will continue to be worked on by students next time the class is offered (specifically during F22)

There will be six groups, each composed of two teams:

| Group | Teams | Project |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 4pm-courses   | s22-4pm-1, s22-4pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 4pm-happycows | s22-4pm-3, s22-4pm-4 | Happy Cows | 
| 5pm-courses   | s22-5pm-1, s22-5pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 5pm-happycows | s22-5pm-3, s22-5pm-4 | Happy Cows | 
| 6pm-courses   | s22-6pm-1, s22-6pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 6pm-happycows | s22-6pm-3, s22-6pm-4 | Happy Cows |
