These are the instructions for the legacy code project phase of the course.

Everything up until now has been a kind of "warm up" for this.  This is when you work on a project that:
* has "real users" 
* has a code base that was worked on by students before this quarter (specifically during W22)
* has a code based that will continue to be worked on by students next time the class is offered (specifically during F22)

There will be six groups, each composed of two teams:

| Group | Teams | Project |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 4pm-courses   | s22-4pm-1, s22-4pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 4pm-happycows | s22-4pm-3, s22-4pm-4 | Happy Cows | 
| 5pm-courses   | s22-5pm-1, s22-5pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 5pm-happycows | s22-5pm-3, s22-5pm-4 | Happy Cows | 
| 6pm-courses   | s22-6pm-1, s22-6pm-2 | Courses    | 
| 6pm-happycows | s22-6pm-3, s22-6pm-4 | Happy Cows |

# High Level Plan

| Teams | Project | Epic | Starter Code  |
|-------|---------|------|---------------|
| 4pm-1, 5pm-1, 6pm-1 | Courses Search | TBD | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-courses-search> |
| 4pm-2, 5pm-2, 6pm-2 | Courses Search | TBD | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-courses-search> |
| 4pm-3, 5pm-3, 6pm-3 | Happy Cows | TBD | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-happycows> |

## Epics

You'll find an overview of what to do in each Epic here; note however, that this is a high-level document, and is subject to
negotiation.  You should talk with the other team you are paired with to make sure you are not duplicating effort, or going in different directions, and that your code will all work together.

You are ultimately evaluated separately, but you are evaluated in part on how well you cooperated with your partner team, and worked for the greater good of both teams.

We have set up repos for each of the teams.  Note that teams work in pairs in the same repo:

| Team | Team | Repo |
|------|------|------|
| s22-5pm-1 | s22-5pm-2 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-5pm-courses> |
| s22-5pm-3 | s22-5pm-4 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-5pm-happycows> |
| s22-6pm-1 | s22-6pm-2 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-6pm-courses> |
| s22-6pm-3 | s22-6pm-4 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-6pm-happycows> |
| s22-7pm-1 | s22-7pm-2 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-7pm-courses> |
| s22-7pm-3 | s22-7pm-4 | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-7pm-happycows> |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}

You will NOT be able to merge your own pull requests in these repos. Instead:
* You need to get the PR to be fully green on CI/CD (i.e. all GitHub actions scripts passing)
* You need to get at least one approved code review from a fellow team member that did not work on the story
* You need to a get a *code review from a staff member*
* The staff member will then merge the PR, *and award points to your team*.

Your team should try  to accumulate 100 points to get full credit (you may go up to 110 for extra credit.)

If you only accumulate 90, that's an A-, 83 is a B, etc.


# Setup Tasks

There are a group of setup tasks that need to be done for both projects.

Then there are a few setup tasks that are specific to each project.

First, the general ones:
