Reading Assignment:

In this homework, you'll need to have read
* HFJ Ch4, HFJ 5
* In JN7, Chapter 2, just the Arrays section pages 82-88
  - If working with an online copy without page numbers, this starts with the heading *Arrays*.  Continue through: *Array Types*, *Creating And Initializing Arrays*, and *Using Arrays*.  You can stop when you get to *Multidimensional Arrays*.
  

The JN7 text has many good qualities: it is very complete and very up-to-date.  But it works better as a reference than a textbook.  

One of its flaws is that it often describes concepts that haven't been defined yet.  As an example, I want to have you read the section on array in JN7 (pages 82-89.)   However, unfortunately, this section almost immediately starts talking about Java interfaces, which is a concept that we haven't gotten to yet; it's in HFJ Ch 8 (and we are on 5), and in JN7 it's discussed on pages 144-152.    

So: as you read through pages 82-89, if you see references to interfaces, just skim over those parts.   We'll return to this topic after we've covered interfaces.

For now, just read pages 82-88, skipping over "Array Type Widening Conversions", and stopping when you get to Multidimensional Arrays.
