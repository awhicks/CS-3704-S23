# Reading Assignment

Read HFJ7 and HFJ8, along with the online reading notes that go with those chapters:

* https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_7/
* https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_8/


Also, in  JN7 the following sections:

* Chapter 2: pp. 33-50 (Starts with 
  "Expressions and Operators" and stops when you 
  get to "Statements")

* Chapter 3: Entire Chapter

* Chapter 4: first section on **interfaces**.
  This updates some of the elements of HFJ's treatment
  of interfaces that is out of date, updating it for 
  Java 11.   You may stop (for this assignment) when 
  you get to the header **Generics**.

Then, do the problems on Gradescope at this link: <{{page.gs}}> 

Refer back to previous chapters as needed.
