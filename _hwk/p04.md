The instructions for this particpation activity are embedded in the lecture notes for 04/14 here: 
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/lectures/lect08/>

To earn this participation grade, you should make a post *to the slack channel* for your team (not in the Zoom chat of your
team's breakout room), and also update your fellow team members verbally during the standup meeting.

The post should contain the elements described in the [lect08](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/lectures/lect08) outline, namely:

* What stage of [team01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/lab/team01/) are you on? Mention the number (2.0 through 2.9), but also describe it in words.
* What are you planning to do next
* What blockers (if any) do you have (answer could be “none”)
