# Reading

Read HFJ Chapters 16 along with the online reading notes that go with those chapters.
Then, do the problems below. Refer back to previous chapters as needed.

Reading notes: 
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_16/>

(Don’t worry that we skipped chapters 12-15. We aren’t using Swing GUIs and we’ll return to serialization, threads and networking later if needed needed.)
