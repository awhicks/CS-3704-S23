The following Google Calendar shows office hours for the course.

For the time being, office hours will be held in the same zoom room as the lecture; see 
[Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu) or the [Course Slack](https://ucsb-cs156-s21.slack.com) for the link.

There is a table of specialities below the calendar, so if you are looking for help with a specific issue, you know who is best in a position to help.  You should also feel free to ask any quesitons of any of the staff, but for some issues, there are folks with particular strengths.
