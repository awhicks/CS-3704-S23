Information about the legacy code projects will be posted after
the staff have set up each of the epics.

However, you can get a sense of what that will look like by looking
at [Fall 2020 Projects Page](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/info/projects)

# W21 Epics

Each of your teams has a Kanban board, shown in this table:


|   | 5pm | 6pm | 7pm|
|---|-----|-----|----|
| 1 | [team-5pm-1]({{page.team_5pm_1_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-1]({{page.team_6pm_1_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-1]({{page.team_7pm_1_kanban}})  |
| 2 | [team-5pm-2]({{page.team_5pm_2_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-2]({{page.team_6pm_2_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-2]({{page.team_7pm_2_kanban}})  |
| 3 | [team-5pm-3]({{page.team_5pm_3_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-3]({{page.team_6pm_3_kanban}})  |                                           |
| 4 | [team-5pm-4]({{page.team_5pm_4_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-4]({{page.team_6pm_4_kanban}})  |                                           |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}

Each of these Kanban boards should have these columns:

| Planning | Todo | In Progress | In Review | Done |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Your teams epic, and issues in the planning stages | Issues that are fully ready for someone on the team to pick up and work on | Issues that someone on the team is currently actively working on | Issues for which there is a pull request ready for review or being reviewed | Issues where the PR has been merged to `main`|
