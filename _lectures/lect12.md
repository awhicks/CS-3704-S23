# Students

* Today, we had a guest: Scott Chow from AppFolio.  See the video for details of the discussion
* We then invited each group to hold a standup, and review your Kanban board for team01
* Teams that have finished team01 can start on team02

# Staff members:

Please check the Kanban boards for team01 for the three teams to which you are assigned.  Check that:

* Each team member has exactly one issue assigned to them in the In Progress column (not less than one, not more than one)
* If there are issues "In Review", check that there is a Pull Request
* If there are issues that are "Done", if applicable, be sure that a PR has been merged
  - This doesn't apply to simple tasks like setting up the Heroku deployment
  - It does apply to anything that involves changing Java Code
