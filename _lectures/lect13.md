# CATME

* Today, we'll do our first CATME survey
* The first CATME survey establishes a base line. 
* Each CATME survey does count as a *participation grade*
* For this first survey, the *results* are not used as part of your grade, since:
  - It's the first time you are doing one of these
  - You may not yet have a fully developed sense of how you are working as a team.
  - So this one is "just for practice, and for information"
* Future CATME surveys *may* be used as a basis for a "team multiplier" of your grade on team assignments.
  - If your team rates your contribution really low, it could impact your grade negatively.

# Students

* Please decide, as a team, to set aside time to fill out your CATME surveys either now, or after class.  
* Please hold a standup meeting
* Please review the status of your Kanban board for `team02`
* If you are *done* with team02, or think you'll be done with team02 before section tomorrow, please let your team mentor know (see: <https://bit.ly/cs156-f22-teams>) 
  and also use an `@phtcon` mention in your Team's slack channel to let the professor know.
* The goal is to finish by 5pm Friday.
  
# Staff members:

Please check the Kanban boards for team02 for the three teams to which you are assigned.  Check that:

* Each team member has exactly one issue assigned to them in the In Progress column (not less than one, not more than one)
* If there are issues "In Review", check that there is a Pull Request
* If there are issues that are "Done", if applicable, be sure that a PR has been merged
  - This doesn't apply to simple tasks like setting up the Heroku deployment
  - It does apply to anything that involves changing Java Code
