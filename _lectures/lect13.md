Tonight's lab is a "traditional lab", i.e. just a work session with the TAs and LAs available to help you with jpa03 and jpa04.

There is no particpation activity or team activity tonight.

Accordingly, you are free to come for help during any of the three scheduled discussion sections. We'll prioritize students in the
"current" session, but will help anyone that shows up, as time permits.

Attendance/participation is at your discretion, but since only two of the students in the course are entirely done with jpa04, we'd encourage everyone else to 
particpate and work on jpa03/jpa04 as appropriate.
