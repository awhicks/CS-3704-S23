In team02, you are working with a Kanban board populated with issues (cards).

This is very real world.

But: in the real world, where do the issues (cards) come from?

That's todays' topic.

# Product Owner / Product Manager

We'll start today with a presentation by TA Kevin Heffernan about the Product Manager/Product Owner role in a software development team.

The short version is that a product owner is the "voice of the customer" on the team.

They:
* Talk to customers, prospective customers, and end users about their needs
  - These are not necessarily the same.
  - The customer is the one that writes the check, that makes the buy/no-buy decision.
  - The end user is the person that actually uses the software.
* Work with the software development team to turn customer needs into "user stories" 
* The user stories are then turned into issues (aka cards on a Kanban board.)

Kevin will tell you more.

# Let's do some product ownerish stuff

## First Exercise: Thinking like an end user

We'll be looking at a piece of software produced by past UCSB CMPSC 156 students (specifically, from F20, W21, S21).
* The repo is here: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s21/proj-ucsb-courses-search>
* The running app is here: <https://proj-ucsb-courses-search.herokuapp.com>
* You can also acccess the Swagger-UI to see the backend API: <https://proj-ucsb-courses-search.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html>
