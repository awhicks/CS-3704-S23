The deadline for new PRs to be submitted is midnight tonight.

After that:
* We'll still do code review of PRs already submitted.
* You will be allowed to make *minor edits* to work already done.
* But the deadline for _starting_ big new PRs has passed.

Today: work session on the Legacy Code Project, i.e. <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/lab/proj01/>

* Standup
* Review Kanban board
* Use `#help-lecture-discussion` to ask staff for assistance
* Do code reviews for one another's PRs
* Try to get PRs merged
