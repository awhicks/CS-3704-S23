# Team Activity: Divide up Listening to Early Career Developers

The team activity for today is described here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/p01/>

When you finish that activity, please ping a member of the staff to check off your team's work.

Once that's done, you are free to go, but you are also invited to stay and work on one or more of these items:

# What then?  

* The autograder is now working for [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa00/)! If you haven't submitted yet (or if you have, but you don't yet have a score of 100%, I suggest working on that.)
* If you've finished [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa00/) then consider moving on to [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa01/), and going as far as you can with that.  I hope to have the autograder for that one working soon as well.

And you can also work on these homework assignments if you haven't yet completed them:

* Work on [H00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h00/)
* Work on [H01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h01/)
* Work on [H02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h02/)
* Work on [H03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h03/)
