# Team Activity: Divide up Listening to Early Career Developers

The team activity for today is described here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/p01/>

When you finish that activity, please ping a member of the staff to check off your team's work.

Once that's done, you are free to go, but you are also invited to stay and work on one or more of these items:

# What then?  

* If you can make progress on [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa00/), I suggest working on that.
* If you've gotten as far as you can with [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa00/) (i.e. you're up to the step of final submission on Gradescope, and have submitted, but because the autograder is broken, you are not getting a valid score, or meaningful feeedback), then consider moving on to [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa01/), and going as far as you can with that.

And you can also work on these homework assignments if you haven't yet completed them:

* Work on [H00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h00/)
* Work on [H01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h01/)
* Work on [H02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h02/)
* Work on [H03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h03/)
