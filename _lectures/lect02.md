Today, we'll discuss:

* Maven
* JUnit
* Jacoco (Code coverage) 
* Mutation Testing

as background for [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa01/).

Today will be an exception to the usual way the course works, in that we may end up using the entire time for a more "traditional lecture"; there's a lot
of ground to cover with these four topics.

We'll use a series of tutorials that are available here, all based on a  simple Java class callled `Student`
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/tutorials/>

You are encouraged to work through tutorials 01 through 09 on your own at a pace suitable for you; our tour in lecture today will be super fast, as we have a lot to cover.

So if you are left a little bewildered, if it all comes too much too fast, don't worry.  Just let as much sink it as can sink in, then go back through it on your own.
