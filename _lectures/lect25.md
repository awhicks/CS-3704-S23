# Announcements

* Discuss how the #help-lecture-discussion channel works
  - Note that it's going to be quite busy over the next few days
* You can propose your own stories!  
  - Just put them on your Kanban board in the planning column.
  - You can start the story directly as an issue, then add it to your Kanban board.
  - Or, if you are pressed for time, or in the middle of something else, create it as a Card then convert to issue later.
  - Then, once it's reasonably well groomed (i.e. has a user story, acceptance criteria, etc.) ask a staff member to look it over,
  - Then drag into ToDo column.
* If/when your team gets to 95 points, 100 points, or 105 points
  - You can earn your last 5 to 15 points, depending, by just having a nice backlog of team-written stories that are available for the W22 CMPSC 156 class.
