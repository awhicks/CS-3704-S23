# Announcements

* Discuss how the #help-lecture-discussion channel works
  - Note that it's going to be quite busy over the next few days
* You can propose your own stories!  
  - Just put them on your Kanban board in the planning column.
  - You can start the story directly as an issue, then add it to your Kanban board.
  - Or, if you are pressed for time, or in the middle of something else, create it as a Card then convert to issue later.
  - Then, once it's reasonably well groomed (i.e. has a user story, acceptance criteria, etc.) ask a staff member to look it over,
  - Then drag into ToDo column.
* If/when your team gets to 95 points, 100 points, or 105 points
  - You can earn your last 5 to 15 points, depending, by just having a nice backlog of team-written stories that are available for the W22 CMPSC 156 class.
  - We can also invoke this if/when your team decides that it might fall short of getting to 100 points, i.e. if you've gotten to 65 or 85 or whatever, 
    and you think it's unlikely
    that you'll get anymore, you can "call it done", and ask us to give you points (0, 5, 10 or 15) for whatever stories the team has added to the backlog.
