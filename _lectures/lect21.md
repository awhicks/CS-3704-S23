# CATME Peer Surveys

You'll be getting an email invitation to do a survey on the CATME.org website.

The survey is the first of three or four times that you'll fill out this survey; the first one is just practice and a baseline.  But the later ones may count as part of your grade.  (Filling it out, however, does count as a participation grade, so if you don't fill it out at all, this can hurt you.)

You'll be asked to provide feedback on each member of your team. There is an oppotunity to provide peer-to-peer ratings and comments; the comments are anonymous, but visible to your peers.    There is also an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to the instructor.

As a result of the calcuations, there is a "multiplier" that can be applied to the team grade that can bump up individuals that are consistently rated by their peers as outstanding performers, and but can also reduce the grade of underperformers.  

The "multiplier" can increase or decrease your course grade by up to a letter grade (I will cap the effect that the multiplier could have at +10% or -10% of your overall course grade.)

The good news from last quarter is that the vast majority of student were rated will by their peers.
