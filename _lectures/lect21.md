# Finish up work on team03 by 5pm next Tuesday

This deadline is *strict*.

* Try to finish up team03 COMPLETELY, BEFORE this coming Tuesday so that you are fully available to start the legacy code projects this coming Tuesday.  
* Starting Tuesday, we'll be grading team03, "ready or not" based on what you've done up to that point, and we won't be helping students with team03 after 5pm next Tuesday,
* We expect by then to be in full "legacy code project" mode.

# Other notes (also shared on `#announcements` on Slack)

* Start each class meeting with a standup (after any introductory remarks by the instructor or TA)
* You may do your standup synchronously out loud, or asynchronously on your Slack channel; we've heard from folks in industry that each method is used (by different teams at different companies).  It's up to the team to determine what works best for them.
* REFLECTION: please do reflect on your practice continuously, and share those reflections in your team slack channel.   Reflection, in this context, means the type of thinking you do in a Retrospective: any observations about what you can start, stop, or continue doing to be more effective as a team or as an individual.
* Discussion section is cancelled on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving day.   However, I encourage you to put in some work to make up for that either before, during or immediately after T'giving break, using your Slack channel to coordinate with your team.
