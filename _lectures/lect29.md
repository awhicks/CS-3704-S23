# Getting PRs merged

Let me encourage you to take the PR that's at the head of the queue (i.e. the oldest one for your team), and if it's in a mergeable state (i.e. passing CI/CD, has peer code review, no outstanding changes requested) then deploy it to your QA branch, with a post like this one:

```
Deploying: staff-s22-pc-restore-pr-48
PR https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s22/s22-6pm-happycows/pull/62
on QAs site; https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/s22-6pm-4-happycows-qa
Build Progress: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/s22-6pm-4-happycows-qa/activity/builds/c122de5b-20a5-4841-94c9-0621b7d51d1a
```

Like this:

That will help speed things along!

# Merge Conflicts

Also, periodically, go through your PR queue (there's a link on each team's slack channel for convenience), and look at each PR for your team.  If you see this, then there are merge conflicts.

If you can, fix them yourself.  If you can't then mark the PR with the "merge conflicts" label, and ping the person on your team that can fix them.

# Out of date branches

If you see this:

Then click to update the branch:

All of this will help all of us get done with this final project (and the grading thereof) much more quickly!
