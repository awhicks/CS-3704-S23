On the calendar at <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/info/calendar/> you can see
the due dates for jspa01, jpa02, and jpa03.

For those of you that are ready to move on to jpa03, it is a new lab that just dropped today.

It involves setting up a non-trivial web app: one that:
* has a real React front end
* has a real Spring boot backend that provides a RESTful API
* uses a Postgres database to store data
* uses Auth0 and Google login to provide authentication

In this lab, you don't *yet* have to do any coding.  It is all about the *configuration* of getting this lab
up and running, first on localhost, and then on Heroku.

Throughout the quarter, as we work on practice projects with React/Spring, and then the three legacy code projects,
you'll need to get instances of the app up and running on localhost and Heroku.

You'll have to go through these configuration steps *many times*. 

So we want you to get used to them as soon as possible.

When you first go through them, it will seem like it takes forever, and you'll probably make lots of mistakes.  It can be really frustrating.

But, after you've done it a few dozens times: it will still seem like it takes forever and you'll make lots of mistakes.  
But by then, you'll be used to it, so it won't hurt so much.

In any case, the staff is here to help!
