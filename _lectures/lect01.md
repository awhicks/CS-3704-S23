The team activity for today is described here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/hwk/p01/>

Also:
* [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/lab/jpa02/) is now available for you to work on as well.  While jpa01 involves actual programming, jpa02 is more about getting use to several tools and frameworks; there isn't much coding, and what coding exists there is pretty "cookbook".
