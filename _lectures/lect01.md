# Overview

Today, we started the first two "Java Programming Assignments", jpa00 and jpa01:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa00>
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/lab/jpa01>

Regrettably:
* the Gradescope autograder for each of those is not working at the moment
* even worse, the debugging mechanism for autograder backends (an ssh connection to the VM) is *also* not working at the moment.

The due dates for both will be adjusted by the number of days (counting from the day of this lecture) until the autograder for each is functional.

But, at least we got started.
