The team activity for today is described here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/hwk/p01/>

When you finish that activity, please ping a member of the staff to check off your team's work.

Once that's done, you are free to go, but you are also invited to stay and work on one or more of these items:

# What then?  
  
* If you haven't finished [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa00/), I suggest working on that.
* If you've done [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa00/) on CSIL, consider doing it again on your own machine, including doing all of the [software setup](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/info/software/) needed for your machine.
* If you've done [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa00/) on you own machine, consider doing it again on CSIL to make sure that your CSIL set up is valid (e.g. your `JAVA_HOME` settings and your ssh keys.)
* Work on [H00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/hwk/h00/)
* Work on [H01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/hwk/h01/)

There is a chance that jpa01 may be ready by the time you are done with all of those things; Conrad has been hacking on it all day to try to get it up-to-date for Java 17 and JUnit 5.  

The assignment is pretty much ready to go, though the Gradescope Autograder still needs some work.
