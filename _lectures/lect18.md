# First Peer Evaluation survey results 

See your results at CATME.org.  You'll see:
* Your self-rating, and the average of your team's ratings, compared to the average for your team
* You'll see that for a few different scales
* You'll also see comments from your peers

Please look over those, and be prepared to discuss those with your team tomorrow and/or Wednesday.

Note: data is missing for six students that did not fill out the survey.  
* If you are one of those six, please fill it out next time.
* If you notice that the number of comments you got is less than the number of people of your team, please encourage your team
  members to fill it out next time.


# Team03 update

See: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/lab/team03/>

All of your apps should now be up and running.
* 10 teams are up and running perfectly
* 1 team is up, but has a problem loading the "Role" from the backend api
* 1 team is still not up at all (home page shows Heroku error message)

For P10, You should each have posted two comments with observations from interacting with your app.

## P10:P Once your team's app is up, then what?

(Repeated from last Wednesday)

If you haven't done it yet, all members of your team should join slack channel for your teams app (i.e. one of `#proj-ucsb-courses-search`, `#proj-ucsb-cs-las` or `#proj-mapache-search`.)
 
Now, start exploring the features of the app, as individuals and as a team.  

As you explore, make posts to your team's slack channel.  Also monitor the discussions, if any, on the project's channel (i.e. one of `#proj-ucsb-courses-search`, `#proj-ucsb-cs-las` or `#proj-mapache-search`.)

Here are questions that should prompt some posts:
* What do you notice that is broken or confusing?
* What questions do you have about how the app is supposed to work, or what problem it is supposed to solve?
* What changes would you make to the user interface to make it easier to use?
* What new features would you add?
* What other questions/comments do you have based on interacting with the app?


** By Monday, each student is asked to please make at least two posts based on interacting with the app. **

If you haven't done that yet, I'll extend that deadline to midnight Tuesday with a 10% deduction for lateness, but please get it done.
