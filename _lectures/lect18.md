Split this into two activites: one for courses, and one for cows.

# Project Manager / Product Owner

In this lecture, Kevin Heffernan will talk a little about product manager/product owner roles on an Agile software development team.

We'll then do some product owner/manager type work: 

We'll look at a few apps that each provide some functionality related to UCSB Courses Search

* The one implemented by the University: <https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/public/curriculum/coursesearch.aspx> 
* The one implemented by the F20/W21/S21 CS156 students: <https://proj-ucsb-courses-search.herokuapp.com/>
* The three implemented by the W22 CS156 students (very much preliminary works in progress):
  * <https://courses-w22-5.herokuapp.com/>
  * <https://courses-w22-6.herokuapp.com/>
  * <https://courses-w22-7.herokuapp.com/>

In team02, you are working with a Kanban board populated with issues (cards).

This is very real world.

But: in the real world, where do the issues (cards) come from?

That's todays' topic.

# Product Owner / Product Manager

We'll start today with a presentation by TA Kevin Heffernan about the Product Manager/Product Owner role in a software development team.

The short version is that a product owner is the "voice of the customer" on the team. Why is this important to you? Because more and more software engineers required to work on product with more organizations becoming decentralized.

They:
* Talk to customers, prospective customers, and end users about their needs
  - These are not necessarily the same.
  - The customer is the one that writes the check, that makes the buy/no-buy decision.
  - The end user is the person that actually uses the software.
* Work with the software development team to turn customer needs into "user stories" 
* The user stories are then turned into issues (aka cards on a Kanban board.)

# Let's do some product ownerish stuff

What we are doing: spending some time thinking about how to design a web application

Why we are doing this: 
* Learning/Educational reasons:
  * Product design is an important skill
  * Good sw dev organizations involve developers in product design
* Practical reasons
  * We are doing a fresh start implementation of proj-ucsb-courses-search
  * Reason: we've found a much cleaner/simpler architecture; easier to learn, easier to add new features
