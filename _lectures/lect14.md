# Today:

* Full 75 minutes work session on team02
* You'll start in your breakout rooms almost immediately
* Please start with a standup meeting
  - Keep it short
  - Target: 6 minutes (60 seconds per member)
  - Upper limit: 12 minutes (2 minutes per member)
* The Standup questions:
  - What are you working on now?
  - Are you blocked by anything?
  - When do you expect to finish (if you can predict that)
  - What will you work on after that?
* Then, *after* standup, you can choose any of these:
  - Work as a team/mob (see below\* for some hints on how to do this effectively.)
  - Work in pairs
  - Work as individuals
* In addition to the team breakout rooms, there are extra breakout rooms available on a first-come/first-served basis.

\* Hints on how to do Mob Programming more effectively:
* [Short article from Agile Alliance website](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/)
* [Longer more detailed article by Woody Zuill, who popularized the concept](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/)

# Why is today a full 75 minute work session?

I did a poll Monday morning asking folks to choose from one of three choices:

* We are done, and ready to move on to something new
* We still need a little more time, but will probably finish up soon    
* We could really use the full 75 minutes today to work as a team and try to make progress   

As of the time I'm typing this, there were 17 responses:
* 16/17 (94%) said they could use the full 75 minutes
* 17/17 (100%) said they needed at least a little more time.
* No one said they were done and ready to move on to something new

And, that last point is corroborated by the fact that as of right now, there are zero submissions on the 
[Gauchospace Assignment for team02](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/assign/view.php?id=948148)

The due date is still midnight Tuesday; I'm hopeful that a full day today, plus some time tomorrow in Section will be
enough to finish up. 

I'll try to have something new for you to work on by 5pm tomorrow night, for teams that manage to finish up before then.

If you finish in the meantime, here are three articles you can read that help you to prepare for upcoming assignments; they are all about MongoDB:
