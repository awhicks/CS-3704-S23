We'll be in "straight lecture mode" again today with no participation grade.

While you are encouraged to participate synchronously, it is acceptable to 
just watch the video later if you are in a time zone where sleep is a better alternative, 
or if you are just juggling other responsibilities.

We have two upcoming team activities planned for next week, so please plan on synchronous participation then:

* A team assignment where you work as a team on front-end code in JavaScript/React that goes with the 
  backend you built in team01.  This will be similar to the team01 assignment, but on the JavaScript/React side. 
  Today's lecture is prep for that.
  
* A separate team assignment where you get your first experience with the legacy code project 
  that you'll be working with in the second half of the course.  

I had anticipated that we'd be starting the legacy code deployment today, but it came to light from students' 
experiences with jpa03 that there were some improvements we could make to the process so that things would go more smoothly.   
So, I think it's worth waiting until next week to get those improvements into the code base.

# What we are building in team02

The team02 assignment is still under development, but here's a preview of the app (in its current state):

As you can see, we still have access to the "Swagger" interface directly to the backend endpoints, but we also have some nicer interfaces intended for human
users.
