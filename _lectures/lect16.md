* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/>
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class
 
* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group. 
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder that you used last Wednesday:

It will look like this (upper left corner where it says "pinned posts".  Otherwise you can search for some of the text, e.g. `In preparation for lecture on Wednesday, a small clerical task: Please check that you:`


<img alt="pinned post" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/153278953-6a9502b3-3431-4c1a-9943-abaf2914f230.png" width="600" />

In that folder, create a folder called `Retros` and in that folder, create a document `Retro01-02-09-2022`

Then follow the instructions in the <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/> article for  Stop/Start/Continue retro.

In the document, write down who your retro leader is.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

After the retro is done, you can:
* do a standup and more work on team02 if you need that
* start looking over the articles on MongoDB linked to here:

If you finish in the meantime, here are three articles you can read that help you to prepare for upcoming assignments; they are all about MongoDB:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/mongodb_new_database/>
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/mongodb_spring_boot_basic_collection/>
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/mongodb_spring_boot_nested_collection/>
