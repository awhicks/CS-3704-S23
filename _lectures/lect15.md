# Today:

* Full 50 minutes work session on team02
* You'll start in your breakout rooms almost immediately
* Use `#help-lecture-discussion` on Slack to ask for help
  - Include in your request whether you are:
  - At a table in SH1431 (indicate which table)
  - In a zoom room (indicate which room)
* Please start with a standup meeting
  - Keep it short
  - Target: 6 minutes (60 seconds per member)
  - Upper limit: 12 minutes (2 minutes per member)
* The Standup questions:
  - What are you working on now?
  - Are you blocked by anything?
  - When do you expect to finish (if you can predict that)
  - What will you work on after that?
* Then, *after* standup, you can choose any of these:
  - Work as a team/mob (see below\* for some hints on how to do this effectively.)
  - Work in pairs
  - Work as individuals
* In addition to the team breakout rooms, there are extra breakout rooms available on a first-come/first-served basis; scroll down to find them.
