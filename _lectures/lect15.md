Discussion section today will be only two things:

1. If your team has not yet collated all of your work in the 01.27 directory of your team's NOTES repo (see [Lecture 10](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/lectures/lect10/) ) into the 01.27/README.md file, please meet and finish that up.    The README.md should be a collection of each individuals contributions.   If you didn't contribute to your team's effort before, this is an opportunity to correct that now.
2. Individual help with [jpa06](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/lab/jpa06/).

If both of these things are true:
* your team is done with the `01.27/README.md`, AND
* you already have a grade of 100% on Gradescope for `jpa06`
then you are excused from today's discussion section.
