The results of the first CATME survey will be released sometime before class starts today (before 5pm Thu Oct 27).  I'm just waiting on one student to finish.

Once they are released, I want to invite you to review them.

There is some detail about CATME results in the "drop down" (if you click the arrow).

<details>
  <summary>About your CATME results</summary>

After they are released, you should be able to see something like this.  (These are all examples from CMPSC 156 but *not* from this quarter).

The three arrows show the student's self-rating, the team average for this student, and the overall average of all team ratings (on this team) for all students on this team.

So in this case, we see that:
* the team rated the student higher than the student rated themself
* lower than the team average
* but not much lower than the team average, and still in the "pretty good to excellent" range.

There will be two boxes like this:
* One for "Contributing to the Team's Work"
* Another for "Interacting with Teammates"

Following that, there are anonymized comments; they include your self-assessment, and the anonymous comment of your teammates.  Again, the example shown below is a real one from CMPSC 156, but not from this quarter's class:
