* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/>
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class
 
* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group. 
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder for your team.  It should be linked in your Slack channel with a `gdrive` link this:

Check that each member of the team is able to access the folder.

In that folder, create a folder called `Retros` and in that folder, create a document `Retro1`

Then follow the instructions in the <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/> article for  Stop/Start/Continue retro.

In the document, write down who your retro leader is.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

After the retro is done, you can:
* Ask a staff member to look over your GDrive document; they'll check it to make sure it has the required elements:
  - items from each member under start/stop/continue
  - dot voting
  - an experiment, including the criteria by which you can know whether the experiment was a success
* Do a standup and more work on team02 if you need that.

* Otherwise, start work on [Homework H07](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/hwk/h07/); it's our first look at JavaScript, in preparation for working on React and the frontend.
