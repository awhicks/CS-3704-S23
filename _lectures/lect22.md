Two parts to today's class:

* Retro on Team03
* Intro to Team04

# Preparing for the Retro

1. Take 5 minutes for each team member to review their individual catme scores, and feedback.
2. Find the Gooogle Drive folder from your last retro.  Review what your team said it would try to do this retro.
3. Choose a retro faciltiator, and scribe  *different from last time*.
4. Scribe, in the folder for retros on Google Drive, create a document `Retro02-02-28-2022`
5. Follow the instructions below for today's retro.
 
# Conducting the Retro

In the document, write down who your retro leader and scribe are.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

When the retro is done, post on `#help-lecture-discussion` that you are finished, and then a team member will help you get started on team04.
