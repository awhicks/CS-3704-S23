# Last Night recap

Last night in discussion section was oriented around this assignment: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/lab/jpa05/>

Teams worked in breakout rooms on getting started on it, and getting as far as possible on it.


# Teamwork is Challenging

* You've probably had good experiences with teams, and also not so good experiences with teams
* You've probably had, perhaps some of each, in this class already too!

If your team experience so far has been "less than ideal":
* That's something to pay attention to...
* But let me try to set your mind at ease.

We are going to be talking a lot about teamwork in this course.   

And having already had some "less than ideal" experiences may actually be a good thing.

* When we talk about teamwork, it helps to have some concrete experiences to relate that to.
* Otherwise, it might seem like a very abstract, uninteresting, theoretical discussion.

# Most real world software development is a team effort

Most software is too large and too complex to be produced or maintained by a single individual.

Teamwork is essential to success.

* Some aspects of teamwork are fairly universal
* Some aspects are specific/contextual to software development

We'll talk about about in this course.

# What is a Team?

From [an article by Jim Sisson](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/how-to/growth-strategies/2013/06/the-difference-between-a-group-and-a.html), emphasis and formatting added:

"What is the difference between a group of employees and a team?"

* "A group is a collection of individuals who coordinate their individual efforts."
* "On the other hand, a *team* is a group of people who *share a common team purpose* and a *number of challenging goals*."

"Members of the team are *mutually committed to the goals and to each other*." 

"This mutual commitment also creates *joint accountability* which creates a *strong bond* and a strong *motivation to perform*."

# Teams don't just happen: The Tuckman Stages

* As the instructor of the course, I've put you in *groups*.
* We've called those groups "teams".
* But, are they teams yet?

A Psychologist named Bruce Tuckman studied what happens with both successful and unsuccessful teams.  His data revealed a set of common stages that teams go through,
which are now known as the "Tuckman Stages":

1. Forming
2. Norming
3. Storming
4. Performing

Later, a fifth stage was added: (5) Adjourning, to describe what happens after a team is finished with its work and no longer working together 
(i.e. what will happen to these ten teams in Mid-March when this course is over.)

More information is available here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development>

Let's take 7 minutes to read the first four stages, and then 8 minutes to complete the exercise linked to below (two multiple choice questions, one short answer.)

# What stage is your team at?

Let's take a moment to read about these, and then do some writing about that.

[This exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnEPhVCGnb4rD4zlNmSTu-fiHFjcQW867VIHT_JOyUAd8scg/viewform?usp=sf_link) counts 
towards your course participation grade.

# In your breakout rooms

* Have each person share on the team slack channel where they think the team is (just write the name of the stage as a single post; you don't have to write the entire explanation).
* Then, invite each person to share (out loud) what they think the team's next steps should be towards both:
  - finishing jpa04 and jpa05
  - making progress on the Tuckman stages, if needed
* Then, work together to finish jpa04 and/or jpa05
* When finished with jpa04/jpa05, there is one more team activity to start (see below)

# In your team repo

Recall that each of you has a team repo for notes:
