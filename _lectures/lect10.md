This day was unusual in that it was 100% pure lecture mode.

The video is here: <https://gauchocast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=24629129-4b66-46ea-8b65-ae290171f7ae>

Topics:
* Orientation to SH 1431


# SH1431

* Has 14 tables with five chairs each
* We'll use tables 1-10, then put teams at table 11 and table 13 (borrowing chairs from tables 12 and 14 as needed.)
* Each table has a flat screen, and there are whiteboards for team use.
* I suggest that folks bring headphones/earbuds with mics for use with Zoom.

# `demo-cra-customized`

The repo [`demo-cra-customized`](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w22/demo-cra-customized) is a front-end only React application that demonstrates
the customizations for CMPSC 156 that we've layered on top of a basic `create-react-app` structure.

This branch of `demo-cra-customized` shows the work we did today:
