Today:

# Standup on team04

# Sprint Planning (at a minimum, do this)

Some teams have already created a Kanban board.  For those that didn't, I  created them.  Links are in the table below.

Today, at a minimum, before your discussion section is over, please aim to:
* Create the columns `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done` on your team's board.
* Create at least a few issues in your repo 
  - NOTE that since you SHARE a repo with another team, your "Issues" column is shared with that team.
  - You can find sample issues under the `/issues` directory in your team's repo, under `epic01`, `epic02`, `epic03`, or `epic04`
  - Unlike in previous assignments, it is now *your team's responsibility* to create the Issue in GitHub, and "groom" it (i.e. add Acceptance Criteria)
* Make sure that each team member is assigned to at least one in-progress issue

That's the minimum bar for today's discussion section.  If you have time to do more, some suggesitons appear below the table of Kanban boards.   There are also a few reminders.

# Some reminders

* Unlike in previous team exercises, you do not have full admin control over the repo.
* In particular, you do not have access to push or merge directly into the default (`main`) branch.
  - It is not universal, but pretty common in industry that devs don't have direct access to push to `master`/`main`
  - Instead, there is a "process" that you have to go through to get stuff merged into `master`/`main`
* The process in this project is also the way you earn points.
* Each team shares a grade for the project, out of 100.
* You may earn up to 110 points; extra 10 count as extra credit (2.5% of course grade, max).
* What you need before a PR can be merged:
  - Linked to an issue
  - Issue is groomed with Acceptance Criteria
  - All Acceptance criteria are met
  - PR has good description
  - All CI/CD checks pass, including mutation testing
  - Approving code review from member of team that didn't work on the issue
  - Approving code review from a staff member

# If you have time to do more than the minimum

Here are some things to do if you have time to go beyond the minimum

1. Get your qa deployments are set up.   See Slack discussion in either [`#help-proj-courses-search`](https://ucsb-cs156-w22.slack.com/archives/C0350JFKJPM/p1646172077158749) or [#help-proj-happycows](https://ucsb-cs156-w22.slack.com/archives/C034XMDFSER/p1646172600790119)
2. Make sure you can clone the repo and get it up and running on localhost.  The discussion at the previous link has some hints about reusuing your OAuth credentials.
