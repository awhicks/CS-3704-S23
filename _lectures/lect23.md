# Tradoffs: Quick Win, vs Maintainability

A case study: https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s21/proj-ucsb-courses-search/pull/292

Bottom line: for the short term
* Sometimes the quick win is the better way to go
* Sometime the more maintainable solution is the better way to go

It's a good idea though, when you do the "quick win" to have a concrete plan for refacoring.
