# Today's class

# PeerEval2 on CATME

* <https://catme.org>  Use your `cgaucho@ucsb.edu` email address to login (NOT `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu`).
* Deadline midnight this coming Tuesday
* Please do it sooner if you can (it will avoid the spam reminding you every 24 hours, or more often as the deadline approaches.)

## If your team is finished with team03

* Note this fact on your team's slack channel
* Do a Retrospective (instructions below)
* Ask your mentor (TA or LA) to do a live staff demo/grading session.
* Watch videos for team03b (see notes on team03b below)

## If your team is NOT finished with team03


* Note that your team is not finished with team03 on the slack channel
* Do a standup, including both an out loud standup, and posting standup updates on the slack channel
* Coordinate among the team members when you'll do your retro *outside of class time*, and post on the slack channel when you've agreed to do that.  Deadline is midnight Wednesday 05/25.
* Spend rest of class time working on team03 until finished
* If you finish during class, if there's *at least 30 minutes left* after you submit on Gauchospace, you can do your retro.
* Otherwise, just move on to getting it graded, or watching the team03b videos.

Retro Instructions
</summary>

# Retrospective: the heart of Agile

The core principle of Agile is "inspect and adapt".  
* It was "inspecting and adapting" that led the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) to their ideas.
* It has been by "inspecting and adapting" that the Agile philosophy continues to grow and develop.

Inspect and Adapt is, in many ways, linked to the *Scientific Method*; 
* we observe
* we form a hypothesis
* we do an experiment

All in the service of doing a better job of software development.

In a retro, the team stops, pauses, reflects, and most importantly *comes up with an actionable change* for their practice.

# Today's Retro

* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/>
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class
 
* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group. 
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder for your team.  It should be linked in your Slack channel with a `gdrive` link this:

<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/166498621-8fc7d61a-4d76-404d-9514-ea4672667ad9.png">

Earlier, you should have created a folder called `Retros` and in that folder, create a document `Retro1`.  

Now create a new document in that folder called `Retro2`

Then follow the instructions in the <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile_retros/> article for  Stop/Start/Continue retro, with one difference:
* As part of your discussion, revisit the experiment from your previous retro
* Discuss: was it a success? 
  - Did we follow through on the change we said we would make?
  - Did we get the results we were expecting?
  - What, if anything, did we learn from this experiment?

In the document, write down who your retro leader is.
  
At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary of the discussion about the previous experiment:
  - Did we follow through on the change we said we would make?
  - Did we get the results we were expecting?
  - What, if anything, did we learn from this experiment?
* A summary at the bottom on a new "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

After the retro is done, you can:
* Ask a staff member to look over your GDrive document; they'll check it to make sure it has the required elements:
  - items from each member under start/stop/continue
  - dot voting
  - discusion of previous experiment
  - a new experiment, including the criteria by which you can know whether the experiment was a success

About Team03b (description, and videos)
</summary>


In team03b, we'll see the rest of the steps for crud operations in React: the missing steps being adding Create and Update.
  
Note that team03b may take various forms; I'm still working out with the staff when we'll be ready to start the legacy code projects.
* At one end of the spectrum, it might not be an assignment at all, but instead, just a set of reference videos you can look at if you need the skills mentioned in them.
* At the other end, it might be a full blown assignment, with every team member implementing the missing operations (Create, Edit) for their database record, on top of team03.
* It might be somewhere in between. 
  
I'll let you know by Tuesday's lecture.  In the meantime, here are the videos.
