In this discussion section, we will discuss team01.


We will then discuss starting <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa03/>.

In your teams do a check in...

* See where each person is with their individual parts of team01
* You may need to do pull requests and/or code reviews for one another
* You may need to finally merge those...

If you can help one another with team01, do that.

Otherwise, try starting jpa03.
