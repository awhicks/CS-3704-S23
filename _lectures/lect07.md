Work session on jpa03.

If you are finished with jpa03, it's ok to miss section today.

If you are not done with jpa03, try your best to **finish it during section today**; even though the deadline is next week, you'll be better prepared for lecture Thursday if you complete it today during section.

In lecture Thursday, the plan is to start a team assignment; you'll need the skills/knowledge from jpa03 to be able to contribute to that.
