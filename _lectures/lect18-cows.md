These instructions are for teams ending in 3 and 4, which will be working 



# Setting up admin users

Your team has its own deployment of the original Happy Cows code (written in Express/Node), at one of these links:


* <https://happycows-og-4pm-3.herokuapp.com/>
* <https://happycows-og-4pm-4.herokuapp.com/>
* <https://happycows-og-5pm-3.herokuapp.com/>
* <https://happycows-og-5pm-4.herokuapp.com/>
* <https://happycows-og-6pm-3.herokuapp.com/>
* <https://happycows-og-6pm-4.herokuapp.com/>

You should also find a Heroku Dashboard link for these.  We've added ONE member of your team; that member of your team should 
add all of the rest.  (If they are absent today, ask Prof. Conrad or Kevin to add someone else, and then they can add the rest.)
