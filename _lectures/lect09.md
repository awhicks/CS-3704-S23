# An important point about code reviews


When you do an approving code review, there is a right way and a wrong way.

The wrong way is to simply make comments like this:

This doesn't trigger GitHub to mark the Pull Request as approved.  To trigger that, here's what you need to do:

1. Click where it says "files changed"

2. Click where it says "Review Changes"

3. Click the `Approve` radio button enter `LGTM` and then click submit review.

Of course, you are also free to either "just comment" or "request changes" if you feel that's appropriate.
But if your intent is to approve, this is the way to go about it.
