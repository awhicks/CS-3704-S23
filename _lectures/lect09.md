* We'll start with a "standup meeting" (first 5-10 minutes, see below)
* Then we'll just work on team01 and/or jpa03


# Standup meeting

Each team member should briefly share, *both* by posting in the slack channel, *and* by saying it out loud for the group assembled and the zoom room, these things: 

1. What issue are you currently assigned tp
2. How is it going
3. Are you blocked on anything
4. When you think you will be finished and ready to take on a new issue.

Then, as a team, make sure that you have a good strategy for working through the issues on your Kanban board over the next week.

# Work on team02

Then, you'll just work as a team or in pairs, individually or in mobs as needed, while getting help from the staff.
