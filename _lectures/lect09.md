* We'll start with a "standup meeting" (first 5-10 minutes, see below)
* Then we'll just work on team01 and/or jpa03


# Standup meeting

Each team member should briefly share, *both* by posting in the slack channel, *and* by saying it out loud for the group assembled and the zoom room, these things: 

1. What issue are you currently assigned tp
2. How is it going
3. Are you blocked on anything
4. When you think you will be finished and ready to take on a new issue.

Then, as a team, make sure that you have a good strategy for working through the issues on your Kanban board over the next week.

# Review your Kanban board as a team

Then, review your kanban board as a team; 

* Make sure each team member has something in the in-progress column on the kanban board. (Unless they are done with both of their issues, and there are no team level issues left to take care of--in that case, they should help with code reviews.)
* Take care of any code review requests, and merge code that's ready to merge.
* Do not merge code that doesn't pass the CI/ checks; only merge branches that are "green on CI".

# Work on team02

Then, you'll just work as a team or in pairs, individually or in mobs as needed, while getting help from the staff.

# P06 (today's participation activity)

* 50% did the student make a standup post in the slack channel?
* 50% do they have a story in the in-progress column on the Kanban board?
