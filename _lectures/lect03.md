# For Wednesday

Please finish up H01.  It is helpful if you can finish it before Wednesday so that you have a chance to look over what your fellow team members wrote.

As a reminder: you are reading one section of Chapter 4 (either 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 or 4.6) and writing answers to three questions.

# Informed Consent Breifing

See slides

# A bit about Spring Boot and jpa02

* The assignment [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/jpa02/) involves setting up a "Hello World" type web application using Spring Boot.
* I'll do a bit of demonstration to show what's happening here and where this is leading.

# Time in your teams

* Check in and see where everyone is with H00
  * If you are all done, you can start reading one another's answers.
* Check in about how you are doing on jpa00, jpa01, jpa02
  * Even though these are individual assignments, the skills are ones you'll need as a team
  * See if you can help one another
  * In *this* course, it's not academic dishonesty as long as you are genuinely helping each other learn, and not just doing each other's work.
  * I trust that you understand the difference.

# The `#help-lecture-discussion` channel on Slack

During lecture and discussion, sometimes we are working in breakout rooms.

There is an "Ask for help" button in Zoom, but **please don't use that**.

Instead, use the `#help-lecture-discussion` channel on Slack.

Here's why:
* When we are in breakout rooms, Conrad will be helping along with the TAs / LAs, moving from room to room helping out.
* The "ask for help" button on Zoom ONLY sends a single notification, and ONLY to Conrad (or in general, the zoom host).
* There is no "queue" and no way for other staff members to see it.
* If Conrad is in the middle of helping someone, that "ask for help" interruption breaks the flow and concentration.

Instead, when you use the `#help-lecture-discussion` channel:

* The staff can prioritize help requests in various ways:
  - sometimes first-come, first-served
  - sometimes by the particular expertise of the individual staff
  - sometimes by urgency / importance
* The staff can share the load
* We can keep track of which requests are already handled, and which are still pending
  - We use various "emoji reacts" to do this.
  - The ðŸ‘€ emoji (`:eyes:`) from a staff member means they are taking responsibility for looking at the issue
  - The âœ… emoji (`:white-check-mark`) from a staff member (or from a team member) means this issue is dealt with.
  - The ðŸ†˜ emoji (`:sos:`) from a staff member is a request for help from the other staff (i.e. I'm looking at this, but I need help figuring it out)
