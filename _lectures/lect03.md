# A few things from online discussions

Java Bytecodes and JIT compilation
* and their relationship to "machine language" and "assembly language"
* Note that simplistic definitions of "compiled language", "interpreted language", etc. don't really fit.
* It's a hybrid model

Mutation testing timeouts
* Timeouts don't affect your grade and are normal
* This is related to the halting problem (a topic of CMPSC 138)

# Next Programming Assignment: JavaScript Programming Assignment 1 (jspa01)

Today, we'll discuss jspa01, the first JavaScript assignment.

Before that, I'll give you:

* a brief overview of the structure of how JavaScript is used in the legacy code assignments
* the role of Jest, React, and React Testing Library

If there is additional time, we'll have a chance for students to work in class on both jpa01 and jspa01, and to ask staff questions.
