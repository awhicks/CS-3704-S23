# Tonight

Tonights's discussion section will only be time to work on jpa01 and jspa01 and get help from the staff.

So, you are strongly encouraged to attend, but if you have already completed both of those assignments (I think that currently applies to only 4 out of 55 students), you are excused from attendance.

This will not always be the case--there will often be things that you need to do as a team during discussion section.  Just not today.
