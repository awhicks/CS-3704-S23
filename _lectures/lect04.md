There are three things to do today:

1. Group Check-in (required for participation grade)
2. Fill out pre-survey for extra credit (optional but encouraged)
3. Help one another with jpa01, jpa02 in teams (optional but encouraged)

# (1) Group Check-in

 In your team's slack channel: Each person make a post indicating
  
 * Done with H01, yes or no?
 * Done with jpa01, yes or no?
 * Done with jpa02, yes or no?
 
 For example it might look like this:
 
 ```
 H01: done jpa01: almost done jpa02: not started yet
 ```
 
or even just:

 ```
 H01: yes jpa01: no  jpa02: no
 ```

You'll use this infomation when we get to part 3 of today's lab.

# (2) Pre-survey

The link to the pre-survey will be posted on Gauchospace and on the Slack.

This is the pre-survey that is for extra credit, which was discusssed yesterday in lecture.

If you missed lecture, consider watching the discussion of the pre-survey here
* [Lecture Video from 01/10 starting at 4:03](https://gauchocast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e3628c82-674c-4578-a75a-ae1a000c1501&start=243)
* For the survey, you only need to watch from 4:04 up to about 28:21 (about 24 minutes; less time if you play it at 1.25x speed.)

Reminder:
* EVERYONE that fills out the pre-survey and post-survey gets 1% extra credit in the course
* You don't have to opt-in to the research study to get the extra credit but I hope that you will.

# (3) Helping one another in your teams

If *everyone* on your team is finished with H01, jpa01, and jpa02:
* Then after items (1) and (2) above you are done for today.
* I encourage, you, though to use the time to read over your fellow team members H01 writings to prepare for tomorrow.
* I also encourage you to work on H02, H03, and H04 if you haven't yet.

If *you* are NOT done with H01, jpa01, and/or jpa02:
* I encourage you to use this time to work on them.
* If you need any help with jpa01 or jpa02, consider asking your fellow team members for help.
* While jpa02 is an individual assignment, it's fine to take turns being either others' pair partners to get through it.

If *you* ARE  done with H01, jpa01, and/or jpa02, but others on your team are not:
* Consider offering to be a pair partner for someone that's still working on it.
* If no-one needs your help, then after items (1) and (2) you are free to go, but we encourage you to consider using the time to read over your fellow studnets H01 submissions, and also to 
  work on H02, H03, H04.
