# Today: P03 (participation assignment)

Today we return to the paper that we read earlier in the quarter.  Each of you contributed some text to a repo:

|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |

# Step 0: (Instructor explain activity, 5-7 minutes)

We'll try to get through this as quickly as possible.

# Step 1: (Individual, 8-10 minutes)

Find your team's repo, and your contribution to it.  Read it over again, and perhaps also skim the section of the paper, to remind you about what you read,
and what you wrote.

The link to the paper is here:  <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>

# Step 2: (First Breakout Group, 30 minutes)

Your first breakout group will be with other people that read the same section as you.   Look for breakout rooms labeled: `Sect 4.1`, `Sect 4.2`,
etc.  Join the appropriate group.

In this breakout room, choose one person as the "time keeper", and a second person as the "scribe". 

Then, go on the course slack, <https://ucsb-cs156-{{page.qxx}}.slack.com>.  You should find that there is a dropdown where you locate channels.

Find the channel for your section, and join it, e.g. `#ltd-4-1-what`, `#ltd-4-2-when`, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/113913471-37f83e80-9791-11eb-839a-82ec9f9fbd0f.png)

Once you've joined that channel, make a post with your name and pronouns, and identifying which group you are a part of.  There will be roughly
12 of you per group if there is full attendance.

The scribe should keep notes in slack channel of the discussion that you have.

The timekeeper should give each member of the room *exactly 2 minutes* 
to share what they thought the **most important takeaways** were from the paper, 
in terms of **what skills students in this class might need to learn to be well prepared for industry** in terms of this category.  

* The timekeeper should go last, and someone else should time them. 
* The scribe should ask someone else to scribe (in the local zoom chat window) while they give their report.   

When each person has finished, everyone should return to the main room, and the scribe should make a post on the `#help-lecture-discussion` channel
to indicate 

# Step 3: (Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

Now, join the regular breakout room for your team.   
Each member of the team should report on their portion of the paper, starting with section 4.1, then 4.2, etc.  Again, give each team member 
2 minutes.

Again, choose a timekeeper and a scribe.  The scribe should write a summary in the team's slack channel capturing the discussion.

You may refer to the notes from the `#ltd-4-1-what`, `#ltd-4-2-when` etc. channels on the slack
channel on Slack, or just report from you own memory, as you see fit.

# Step 4: (Still in Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

Now, in your same breakout room, make a list (as a group) of (at least) six learning goals you have between now and the end of the course, i.e. things that you want to "be able to do" by the end of this course.

They may relate 1-1 to the six themes in the paper, or they may be different; the point is that they are things that are meaningful
to the members of your group, knowing what you know from your own experiences, as well as what you've learned from this paper.

Put that list on your team's Slack channel (e.g. team-5pm-a, etc.), along with a list of the names of the group members that contributed to your discussion.

# Step 5: Finishing up (check in with staff)

When that's done, you are almost finished with today's lecture activity; please ask a staff member to check that you are done (any staff member can do this), and put `P03 Done!` in your teams slack
channel.   

After that, everyone is free to go, or if there is remaining time, you may stay and discuss the current programming assignments (jpa01, jpa02), or
any other aspect of the course with one another, and/or the staff.
