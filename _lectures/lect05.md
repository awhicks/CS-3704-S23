# Note about today's assignment

# Today: P03 (participation assignment)

Today we return to the paper that we read earlier in the quarter.  

Each of you contributed some text to a repo when working on [P01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/p01/) and [H03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/hwk/h03/)

Here are links to those repos:

As a reminder, you wrote a summary of material from Section 4 of this paper: <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>

Where Section 4 is divided up as follows:


| Section | Title | Academia | Industry | 
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |
| 4.5 | How: Ad-Hoc vs. Professional | ad-hoc tools and practices |  professional tools and formal practices |
| 4.6 | How Big: Small vs. Large Codebases | small programs | large complex systems |

# Step 0: (TA explain activity, 5-7 minutes)

One of the TAs (Abishek or Vivian) will briefly walk explain the steps in the activity, and indicate where the six meeting places will be.

Two will be at the tables in Phelps 3525, and four may be in Phelps 3526.

# Step 1: (Individual, 5 minutes)

Find your team's repo, and your contribution to it.  Read it over again, and perhaps also skim the section of the paper, to remind you about what you read, and what you wrote.

The link to the paper is here:  <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>

# Step 2: First Group (Six groups)

Your first breakout group will be with other people that read the same section as you.  

The TAs will indicate where each group will meet.  If there is full attendance in each section, there should be four people per group.

| Section | Title | Academia | Industry | 
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |
| 4.5 | How: Ad-Hoc vs. Professional | ad-hoc tools and practices |  professional tools and formal practices |
| 4.6 | How Big: Small vs. Large Codebases | small programs | large complex systems |

On zoom: scroll down past the breakout rooms for your teams, past the numbered breakout rooms, and look for breakout rooms labeled: `ltd-4-1`, `ltd-4-2`, etc.  Join the appropriate group.

**On Zoom, you will have to join the right breakout room manually**.  You will not be placed in these rooms by default.

Each group of four should choose one person as the "time keeper", and a second person as the "scribe". 

Then, go on the course slack, <https://ucsb-cs156-{{page.qxx}}.slack.com>.  You should find that there is a dropdown where you locate channels.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/113913264-f798c080-9790-11eb-8ff9-ac528e786d81.png)

Find the channel for your section/group, and join it, e.g. `#5pm-ltd-4-1-what`, `#7pm-ltd-4-2-when`, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/113913471-37f83e80-9791-11eb-839a-82ec9f9fbd0f.png)

Once you've joined that channel, make a post with your name and pronouns, and identifying which group you are a part of.  There will be roughly
4 of you per group if there is full attendance.

The scribe should keep notes in slack channel of the discussion that you have.

The timekeeper should give each member of the room *exactly 2 minutes* 
to share what they thought the **most important takeaways** were from the paper, 
in terms of **what skills students in this class might need to learn to be well prepared for industry** in terms of this category.  

* The timekeeper should go last, and someone else should time them. 
* The scribe should ask someone else to scribe while they give their report.   
* It can be helpful for the scribe to share their screen so that everyone can see the notes they are taking.

When each person has finished:
* everyone should return to the main room
* the scribe should make a post on the `#help-lecture-discussion` channel to indicate that the group is finished, e.g. `ltd-5pm-4-3-who is Done!`

# Step 3: (Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

Now, join the regular table / breakout room for your team (e.g. Table 1 for `#f22-5pm-1`, Table 2 for `#f22-5pm-2` etc.).   

Each member of the team should report on their portion of the paper, starting with section 4.1, then 4.2, etc.  Again, give each team member 2 minutes.

Again, choose a timekeeper and a scribe.  The scribe should write a summary in the team's slack channel capturing the discussion.

You may refer to the notes from the `#ltd-4-1-what`, `#ltd-4-2-when` etc. channels on the slack
channel on Slack, or just report from you own memory, as you see fit.

# Step 4: (Still in Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

Now, in your same breakout room, make a list (as a group) of (at least) **six learning goals** you have between now and the end of the course, i.e. things that you want to "be able to do" by the end of this course.

They may relate 1-1 to the six themes in the paper, or they may be different; the point is that they are things that are meaningful
to the members of your group, knowing what you know from your own experiences, as well as what you've learned from this paper.

Put that list on your team's Slack channel (e.g. team-4pm-a, etc.), along with a list of the names of the group members that contributed to your discussion.

Example:
```
By the end of the course, we will be able to:
* Use GitHub to manage group work in a team (how)
* Understand how to get started with a new large code base (how big)
etc.
```

Ideally, you'd come up with at least one learning goal that corresponds to each of the six sections of the paper.   It's ok if you have more than six.

# Step 5: Finishing up (check in with staff)

When that's done, you are almost finished with today's lecture activity; please ask a staff member to check that you are done (any staff member can do this), and put `P03 Done!` in your teams slack
channel.   

After that:

* Technically, everyone is free to go; BUT
* We encourage you if there is remaining time, to stay and work on jpa01 and/or jpa02, while the staff is available to help.
* Use `#help-lecture-discussion` to ask for assistance.
