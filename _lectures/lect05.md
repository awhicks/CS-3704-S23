# jpa02: Spring Boot Hello World

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/lab/jpa02/>

Please don't get overly intimidated by the pace at which stuff is coming at you.

I'm trying to make sure that I have stuff for folks that are ready for it, while also giving you plenty of time to work through things at a reasonable pace.

This new assignment has virtually no programming: it's basically just one or two lines of code, and we (almost) tell you exactly what to type.

Plus, the deadline for this is way out there.

# What is this assignment?

Getting a web app up and running on:
* localhost
* Heroku
