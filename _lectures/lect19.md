Our course meeting on 02/16 is a pure work session on [team03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/lab/team03/).

Here are some notes that were put on the Slack before the work session:

# Start with Standup

We'll invite you to start with a "standup meeting" on team03

Please post a written update in the slack channel along with your verbal update

* What have you gotten done since yesterday (if anything)
* What are you working on now (and with whom, if you are pairing),
* Are there any blockers (.e.g things you are stuck on, things you are waiting for from others) 
* What do you think you might have done by next standup

# Plan for standup outside of class

Since we don't have lecture on Monday (University Holiday: "Presidents Day"), the "next standup" is not until next Tuesday, six days from now.

While I can't really "require" you do this, I want to strongly encourage you to *schedule at least one standup between now and next Tuesday* at a time convenient to the team.

Ideally, this would be a synchronous meeting, either in person or on zoom as you see fit.

But, if you can't find a time to do that synchronously, then consider an "asynchronous" standup where, for example, sometime on Friday between 9am and 5pm, each of you posts a "standup update" on your Slack channel.
