# Legacy Code projects: First Sprint

Today, we'll do our best to get started on the legacy code projects.  

* We are doing our best to find 36 "starter stories" (that's 3 per team) that you can get started on.  
* Our goal is find stories that are straightforward, where the code changes and tests you need to write are not terribly difficult, so that you can practice
  the process of engaging with these applications first.
* This is a "first sprint", i.e. a first round of work before doing a retrospective to check in and see how the team is doing.

Each team has a Kanban board, here:

|   | 5pm | 6pm | 7pm|
|---|-----|-----|----|
| 1 | [team-5pm-1]({{page.team_5pm_1_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-1]({{page.team_6pm_1_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-1]({{page.team_7pm_1_kanban}})  |
| 2 | [team-5pm-2]({{page.team_5pm_2_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-2]({{page.team_6pm_2_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-2]({{page.team_7pm_2_kanban}})  |
| 3 | [team-5pm-3]({{page.team_5pm_3_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-3]({{page.team_6pm_3_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-3]({{page.team_7pm_3_kanban}})  |
| 4 | [team-5pm-4]({{page.team_5pm_4_kanban}})  | [team-6pm-4]({{page.team_6pm_4_kanban}})  | [team-7pm-4]({{page.team_7pm_4_kanban}})  |

One of the first things you'll need to do is set up this board with the columns shown here. (You already practiced this as part of the first
round of work on team02.    You will likely find that you already have the planning column, and perhaps the Todo column also; add the others to the right.

| Planning | Todo | In Progress | In Review | Done |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Your teams epic, and issues in the planning stages | Issues that are fully ready for someone on the team to pick up and work on | Issues that someone on the team is currently actively working on | Issues for which there is a pull request ready for review or being reviewed | Issues where the PR has been merged to `main`|
