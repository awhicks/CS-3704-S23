# Today's class

# PeerEval2 on CATME

DEADLINE TONIGHT... PLEASE GET IT DONE, and don't make me chase you down.

* <https://catme.org>  Use your `cgaucho@ucsb.edu` email address to login (NOT `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu`).
* Deadline midnight tonight
* Please do it sooner if you can (it will avoid the spam reminding you every 24 hours, or more often as the deadline approaches.)

# Start on the legacy code project (25% of your course grade)

* Here are the instructions: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/lab/proj01/>
* This project is the **only work remaining in the course** other than 
  - Final presentations (done during the final exam time slot)
  - Take-home Final Exam (done via Gradescope)
  - this CATME eval, and one more after the final presentations
