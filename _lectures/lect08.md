# Extra Credit Opportunity (Survey)

* I'm part of a team of four faculty (me, plus two professors at Washington State University, and one at Humboldt State University) that are studying
  ways to improve how we prepare CS/CE students for work as professional software developers.   This is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
* As part of that research, I'd like to **ask your permission to collect some data**; this data is used to see whether what we are doing in this course
  (and with the NSF's money) is effective or not.  That is: does it make the course better, worse, or make no difference?
* Each student is free to say yes or no, and it will not affect your grade.
  - Wait, I thought you said there was extra credit?
  - Yes: you can get the extra credit regardless of whether you say yes or no to participating in the research.
  - Stay tuned: there's more explanation to come.
  
* As we'll explore today, there are **ethical safeguards in place** to protect you as students, and as individuals whenever someone is collecting data for research
  purposes.   
* Part of these ethical safeguards is something called an **informed consent briefing**.

# Informed Consent as a topic

On one level, today's activity is about collecting data for the research.

But, I also want to explore the idea of "informed consent" as a topic in the course.

Reason: 
* Many tech companies have access to a lot of data about you.
* They have the opportunity to do a lot of "research" with that data
* Should they have to get your informed consent before they do?
 
This questions has ethical, moral, and legal dimensions. ([What's the difference?](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-morality-law-whats-the-difference/)

While we aren't necessarily going to explore those questions today, I hope that this helps frame talking about the "informed consent" process as something relevant to anyone building applications.

# What is an Informed Consent Briefing

The form that I'm inviting you to fill out contains an "informed consent briefing".  

* Whenever university employees conduct research that involves people, this is considered "Human Subject Research".  
* At various times in history, research involving humans has gone very wrong, resulting in great harm.   As such, there are strict rules regarding "Human Subject Research".
* Any time humans are involved, whether it's something as mundane as "giving them a survey" or as extreme as injecting them with an experimental drug, or
  performing a new surgical procedure, it still falls under the same set of rules
* The rules for educational research have been very streamlined: as the work in this study has been judged as "exempt" from most of them.
* However, while this research is "exempt" from some of the more detailed record keeping, I'm still responsible for following the basic principles
  that govern human subject research.  One of the most important is the principle of "informed consent".

Informed consent is a legal term, and I am not a lawyer.  But the essence is this: I'm not allowed to include you in a study, or collect data about you unless/until
you are
* informed about the study
* you agree to participate in the study

Part of the reason the informed consent briefing is so long is because there are elements that it must contain, by law.

One of those is that if you are under 18, you are not legally permitted to give consent with your parents/legal-guardian also consenting.  This doesn't come up very often, but it does sometimes come up.  

So, let's walk through the text of the informed consent briefing:
