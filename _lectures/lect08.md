# Announcements

* Conrad's office hours will be 3:30-4:30pm today instead of 2pm-3pm as usual.
* This means they will overlap a bit with Andrew's.  
* We might use breakout rooms to manage this.

# Introduction to JavaScript and React

* Create React App 
  - <https://create-react-app.dev/> describes a script that can be used to create a React app.
  - I'll demonstrate
  - You can also look at <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w22/demo-cra-plain>
  
* Customized Version of Create React App
  - Everything is moved into `frontend` so that it can live in the same repo as a backend app
  - We've added GitHub actions scripts for running tests (Jest) and code coverage (also Jest)
  - We've added linting with ESLint and a GitHub actions script for that

* Even more customized version of Create React App
  - Adds Storybook
  - Adds Stryker mutation testing
