Today, we will start on `team01`.

Please see the instructions here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/lab/team01/>

There is a participation activity, p05, which is explained in Step 1.1.

Please at least do that part today during class.

# Please set aside jpa03 questions

27 of the 72 students are done with jpa03; but for those that aren't, I've extend the deadline by two additional days so that you can get help *during office hours*.

Office Hours are listed here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/info/office_hours/>

But for today, let's focus our attention on team01.

# Reminderrs:

* If you haven't done the pre-survey, it will close soon! 
* The link is on Gauchospace. Please do it by midnight tonight if at all possible!
* Otherwise, you lose the opportunity for the extra credit (and we lose important research data).
